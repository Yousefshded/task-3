    "No matter what operating system you use, changing router settings lets you block sites across all browsers and computers. Keep in mind that this will affect everyone in your household or business.\n",
    "1.\tFind your router’s IP, and type it into any browser’s address bar to get to its settings page. Try 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1, or use this guide to find it. You’ll also need your router username and password. If you haven’t changed it, the username is usually admin, and the password admin, password, or leaving it blank. If that doesn’t work, check your router’s manual.\n",
    "2.\tOnce you’re in your router settings page, look for a setting called Block Sites, Access Restrictions, or something similar. You might find it under Security, Parental Controls, or Advanced. Every router is different, so again consult your manual.\n",
    "3.\tOnce you find the setting, enter the domains you want to block. Now no one connected to this network can visit that site.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Double-click on the file named \"hosts\" and select Notepad from the list of programs to open the file. Click OK. The last two lines of the hosts file should read \"#127.0.0.1 localhost\" and \"#::1 localhost\".\n",

    "3 . In the window that pops up, select the account again and check Full Control. Click Apply > Yes. Now click OK in all the popups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 . At the end of the file, you can add URLs to block. To do this, just add a line at the end of the file, with 127.0.0.1 and then the name of the site you want to block - this will redirect the site name to your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To block Google, for example, add \"127.0.0.1 www.google.com\" to the end of the file without the quotes. You can block as many sites as you want in this way, but remember that you cannot add more than one site per line.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Now close the hosts file and click save. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect and you'll find that all these websites are now blocked"
